Basic
=====

It is necessary to:
- have been installed ffmpeg configured with '--enable-shared' option

It is recommended to:
- use gauche 0.8.12 or later
- use the SVN release of ffmpeg


Command lines
=============

$ ./configure
$ make
$ make check
# make install

Or simply
# gauche-package install Gauche-ffmpeg-0.1.1.tgz


Tutorial
========

If libavcodec or libavformat is installed in a non standard directory, you will want to:
$ make CPPFLAGS='-I/opt/foo/include' LDFLAGS='-L/opt/foo/lib'
instead of just make.


Distribution Specific
=====================

* Debian (etch)
First you have to assure that the old packages of ffmpeg has been removed, namely:
# aptitude purge ffmpeg libavcodec-dev libavformat-dev

Then install some additional libraries:
# aptitude install libvorbis-dev

Now build and install the current version:
$ cd /path/to/ffmpeg
$ ./configure  --enable-shared --disable-static --enable-gpl --enable-libvorbis --disable-ffserver --disable-ffplay
$ make
# make install

And if you get:
$ ffmpeg -version
ffmpeg: error while loading shared libraries: libavformat.so.50: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
then you may need to:
# echo /usr/local/lib > /etc/ld.so.conf.d/ffmpeg.conf
# ldconfig
