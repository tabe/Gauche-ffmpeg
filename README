project description
-------------------

Gauche-ffmpeg is an experimental project for Gauche users to associate with FFmpeg,
which provides a complete solution to manipulate audio/video.
Since FFmpeg is constantly evolving so far, it has much useful but slightly complex libraries.
Now the principal aim of this project is simplicity, which will keep its API clear and stable.
